        <h1>Barbeque Chiken Grilled Pizza</h1>
        <img src="pizza.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>
            Quick and easy for those summer cookouts. I often make as an 
            appetizer while the ribs are cooking. Use whatever toppings you 
            normally like on regular pizza, but the barbeque chicken is 
            always a crowd pleaser! The dough never makes a perfect 
            rectangle, but we have fun guessing what it looks like 
            ('That looks like America!'). For the chicken, I use the grilled 
            chicken pre-cooked at the store.

        <h2>Ingredients(This Yields 6 Servings)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup chopped cooked chicken</li>
            <li>Â½ cup barbeque sauce, divided</li>
            <li>1 (13.8 ounce) package refrigerated pizza dough</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup diced tomatoes, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Step 1
                <p>
                    Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> Step 2
                <p>
                    Mix chicken and 2 tablespoons barbeque sauce together in 
                    a bowl until evenly coated.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> Step 3
                <p>
                    Roll dough onto a work surface and cut in half to form 
                    2 rectangles. Brush the top of each rectangle with olive 
                    oil.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> Step 4
                <p>
                    Place dough, oil-side down, onto the grill; cook until 
                    bottom of dough is browned and top is bubbling up, about 
                    5 minutes. Brush the tops of each dough with oil and flip.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> Step 5
                <p>
                    Spread the remaining barbeque sauce over each crust; 
                    top with chicken, Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, and tomatoes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> Step 6
                <p>
                    Close the lid of the grill and cook pizza until cheese 
                    is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove pizza from grill and 
                    cool before slicing, 2 to 3 minutes.
                </p>
